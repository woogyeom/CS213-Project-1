Project Description  
Your team will develop a software “Collection Manager” to manage an album collection. For each album, the system 
shall keep track of the title, release date, artist, genre, and ratings. The software shall provide the following 
functionality. 
1. Add an album to the collection. 
2. Remove an album from the collection.  
3. Rate an album in the collection, with a scale of 1 to 5. 
4. Display the albums in the collection sorted by release dates, by genre, or by rating.  
The software is an interactive system where the users enter command lines on the terminal, and the system 
immediately generates responses and output the results on the terminal. That is, when the user hits the enter key, the 
system reads the data entered, process the data, and immediately output the results.
